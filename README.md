## Features

- **Natural language to SQL conversion**: Ask questions like "How many Nike t-shirts are in stock?" and get answers instantly.
- **Semantic similarity retriever**: Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for understanding your queries.
- **Few-shot example selector**: Employs ChromaDB to select relevant examples for better SQL generation.
- **Final answer returned**: You get the answer, not just the SQL query.
- **Optional FastAPI support**: (Commented in code) for API-based deployments.

## Project Description

SQL Query Assistant bridges the gap between business users and complex databases. By leveraging advanced language models and semantic retrieval, it allows anyone to query a MySQL database using plain English. The system interprets your question, finds relevant examples, generates the appropriate SQL, executes it, and returns the final answer‚Äîall through a simple Streamlit interface. This makes data access fast, intuitive, and accessible to non-technical users.

## Database Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hussin-sobhy/sql_chatbot.git
   cd sql_chatbot
   ```

2. **Run MySQL locally:**
   - Make sure MySQL is installed and running on your machine.
   - Import the database schema and data:
     ```bash
     mysql -u <username> -p < init_db.sql
     ```
     Replace `<username>` with your MySQL username (usually `root`). You'll be prompted to enter your MySQL password.

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**
   No need to manually create the database ‚Äî the `init_db.sql` file already includes:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE atliq_tshirts;
   USE atliq_tshirts;
   ```

3. **Set environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values:
     - `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., `mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost/atliq_tshirts`)
     - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (for language model access)
